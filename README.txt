Requires a compiler with C++11 support (such as gcc 4.7)

The code has, in the past, worked under Cygwin; however it has not been
tested/used in ages and is completely unspported.  Everything should work
(with some small tweaks for python related libraries) pretty much out of the
box on any recent Fedora or Ubuntu distribution.  You'll need at least the
following libraries (names will vary with distribution) libxml2-dev,
zlib-dev, libaspell-dev, libpspell-dev, libboost-dev, libboost-python3-dev, python3-dev

You'll also need the latest config & area files, which are available at: http://www.mudbytes.net/file-2882
